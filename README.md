# Kipcorn v0.1.0

To fry a kipcorn, deep-fry it in hot oil at 160-175°C for about 5–7 minutes, or until it is golden brown and cooked through. Place the kipcorn in the hot oil and fry in batches without crowding the pan. Once cooked, remove the kipcorn and drain it on a wire rack to maintain crispiness, then serve it hot with a sauce of your choice.

Whoops, wrong documentation.

Kipcorn is a low level window and input library written in C, with minimal dependencies.

Currently, Kipcorn only supports Linux with Wayland, and has a limited featureset.

At Kipcorn v1.0, it is planned to support all major desktop platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS) with a wide range of toggleable features for maximum modularity.
